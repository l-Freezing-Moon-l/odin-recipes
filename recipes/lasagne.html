    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Lasagne is a classic Italian dish. Likely in the top three someone would think
        of when asked to name an Italian dish. Especially if you ask Garfield.

    <p>
        This dish is really easy to make and consists of only a handful of ingredients.
        One pan of lasagne is enough to feed the whole family for a few days. Especially 
        when served with garlic bread and a salad. Unless you have an orange cat that is.
        Then you will only get the bread and green stuff.
